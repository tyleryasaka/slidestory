slidestory
==========

Bare bones easy-to-use html slideshow, with description for each image and 'next', 'previous' buttons. Uses HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Jquery.

See an example:

This widget is pretty simple and straightforward. You can create as few or as many slides as you like. Just add more images and descriptions to the html, and the script will automatically detect them.

Notice that this uses Jquery, so be sure to include it before the "slidestory.js" file.

Feel free to modify the html/css/javascript to make it fit your needs.
